ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Kevin Quach, a passionate software engineer eager to kickstart my career as a new grad. I'm currently seeking exciting opportunities in the tech industry.

ðŸ’» I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the Illinois Institute of Technology, maintaining a solid GPA of 3.5/4.0. Throughout my academic journey, I gained valuable experience in software development and honed my skills in languages such as Java, Python, C, and SQL.

ðŸš€ I love building scalable, user-friendly applications, and I have experience working with a range of technologies and frameworks, including React, Node.js, Express.js, and React Bootstrap. I've also worked with databases like MongoDB and Postgres, ensuring efficient data management.

ðŸ’¼ Here's a glimpse into my project work:
- Marvel Contest of Champions Companion: A full-stack application providing up-to-date information for the mobile game Marvel Contest of Champions. Users can find suggested counters for characters and filter them based on attributes like class and release year.
- Bloglist: A full-stack application developed with React, Node.js, MongoDB, Redux, and React Bootstrap. Users can share blogs, like and comment on other users' posts, with data stored in a MongoDB database.
- Civil Advocacy App: A Java-based mobile application that displays interactive lists of political officials representing the current or specified location. Government official data is retrieved via the Google Civic Information API.
- News Aggregator: A Java mobile application that aggregates news articles from various sources, utilizing the News API to acquire news sources and articles.

ðŸŒŸ Apart from technical skills, I also have experience working in a fast-paced retail environment as a Cashier at Dollar Tree. I developed excellent teamwork and customer service skills, consistently meeting or exceeding sales targets.
